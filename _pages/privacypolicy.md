# Privacy Policy for IntervalTimer

Effective Date: August 3, 2025

Juxhin Bakalli Technologies (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your
privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and
your rights in relation to it for our application, IntervalTimer (“App”).

## 1. Information We Collect
To provide and improve our service, we collect two types of information, each handled
differently:

a) Health & Workout Data (HealthKit Integration)
With your explicit permission, the App integrates with Apple’s HealthKit to save your
completed workouts. This may include:
- Workout duration
- Active energy burned
- Heart rate data recorded during the workout

This data is written directly to the Apple Health app on your device and is managed by
you. We do not have access to this information, and it is never transmitted to our 
servers or shared with any third party. Your HealthKit data is protected by Apple's
privacy and security measures.

b) Analytics & Usage Data
If you provide consent, we collect anonymized data about how you interact with the App.
This helps us understand user behavior, fix bugs, and improve features. This data is
non-personal and cannot be used to identify you. It includes:
- A pseudonymous, random identifier for your device.
- Device type (e.g., iPhone 15), OS version, and country.
- In-app events, such as starting a workout, changing a setting, or creating a new
timer.

<br>

## 2. How We Use Your Information
- Health & Workout Data is used exclusively to provide the core feature of saving your
workouts to the Apple Health app, at your direction.
- Analytics & Usage Data is used solely for internal purposes to improve the App’s
functionality, user experience, and to identify and resolve technical issues.

<br>

## 3. Data Sharing with Third Parties
We do not sell, rent, or trade your data. We use one third-party service for analytics,
provided you have given consent:

- Firebase Analytics: A service from Google that helps us analyze app usage. The
anonymized data described in section 1(b) is shared with Firebase for this purpose. You
can learn more about Google's privacy practices here:
https://policies.google.com/privacy

<br>

## 4. Lawful Basis for Processing (GDPR)
For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), our lawful basis for processing Analytics
& Usage Data is your explicit consent. You provide this consent through the pop-up
screen when you first launch the App. You can withdraw this consent at any time.

The processing of Health & Workout Data is based on your explicit consent provided
through the HealthKit permission prompt.

<br>

## 5. Your Privacy Rights & Choices
You have control over your data.
- Analytics Consent: You can grant or withdraw your consent for analytics collection at
any time in the App’s Settings screen.
- HealthKit Access: You can manage the App’s permission to read and write HealthKit data
at any time in the Apple Health app (Health > Sharing > Apps > IntervalTimer).
- GDPR Rights: If you are an EEA resident, you have the right to access, rectify, or
erase your data, and to object to or restrict its processing. As we do not store
personal data on our servers, these rights primarily apply to the data managed by you
within the App and HealthKit. For any inquiries, please contact us.

<br>

## 6. Data Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information
we collect. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.

<br>

## 7. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly
collect data from them. If you believe your child has provided us with information,
please contact us so we can address the situation.

<br>

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page
with an updated effective date.

<br>

By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.
